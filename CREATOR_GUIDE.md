# Creative Asset Submission Guide for Creators

Welcome! This guide explains how to organize and submit your creative assets for processing.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

### **Option 1: Simple Folder Organization (Recommended)**

Organize your files into folders by **category**. The folder name will be used to categorize your creatives.

```
YourCreatives/
├── Ahegao/
│   ├── video1.mp4
│   ├── video2.mp4
│   └── video3.mp4
├── Blowjob/
│   ├── clip1.mp4
│   └── clip2.mp4
├── Hentai/
│   ├── anime1.mp4
│   └── anime2.mp4
└── Cumshot/
    └── video.mp4
```

**Folder Naming Format:**
- `Category` (e.g., `Ahegao`, `Blowjob`, `Hentai`)
- `Category-Style-Creator` (e.g., `Hentai-Anime-Pedro`, `Blowjob-Real-Seras`)

**File Naming:**
- Any name you want! (e.g., `video1.mp4`, `clip_001.mp4`, `my_animation.mp4`)
- Files will be automatically renamed during processing

---

### **Option 2: Advanced Structured Naming (Optional)**

If you want more control, you can use structured filenames:

**Format:**
```
{Language}_{Category}_{ModelSex}_{Style}_{Rating}_{Type}_{Creator}_{TestID}.{ext}
```

**Example:**
```
EN_Ahegao_F_Anime_NSFW_Generic_Seras_001.mp4
```

**Field Definitions:**
- **Language:** `EN` (English), `ES` (Spanish), `FR` (French), `JP` (Japanese)
- **Category:** `Ahegao`, `Blowjob`, `Hentai`, `Cumshot`, etc.
- **ModelSex:** 
  - `M` = Male
  - `F` = Female
  - `T` = Trans
  - `MFT` = All/Mixed
- **Style:**
  - `Anime` = Animated/cartoon style
  - `Real` = Realistic/live action
  - `Both` = Mix of styles
- **Rating:** `SFW` or `NSFW`
- **Type:** `Generic`, `Solo`, `3Pannel`, etc.
- **Creator:** Your name (e.g., `Seras`, `Pedro`)
- **TestID:** Optional test identifier (e.g., `001`, `A`, `Test1`)

## 🎬 File Requirements

### **Video Files:**
- **Format:** `.mp4` (preferred)
- **Duration:** 
  - Native ads: Any length
  - In-Stream video: **5-31 seconds only** (will be rejected if outside this range)
- **Resolution:** Any (will be resized for native if needed)

### **Image Files:**
- **Format:** `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`
- **Resolution:** Any (will be resized for native if needed)

---

## 📋 Metadata Requirements

For **each folder**, we need to know:

1. **Category** (e.g., Ahegao, Blowjob, Hentai)
2. **Model Sex:** M (Male), F (Female), T (Trans), or MFT (All)
3. **Style:** Anime, Real, or Both
4. **Creator Name** (e.g., Seras, Pedro, Maria)
5. **Language** (e.g., EN, ES, FR, JP)
6. **Content Type:** SFW or NSFW
7. **Description:** Brief description (e.g., "Generic", "Solo Female", "3 Panel")
8. **Test ID** (optional): If this is a test variant (e.g., "001", "A", "Fall-Sale")

**You only need to provide this once per folder!** We'll save it for future uploads.

---

## 📦 Submission Methods

### **Method 1: Google Drive (Recommended)**

1. Create a main folder with your name (e.g., "Pedro Creatives")
2. Inside, create subfolders by category:
   ```
   Pedro Creatives/
   ├── Hentai-Anime/
   ├── Blowjob-Real/
   └── Ahegao-Real/
   ```
3. Share the folder link with us
4. **Keep the folder structure intact!** We'll download and process it directly

### **Method 2: Zip File**

1. Organize files in folders as shown above
2. Zip the main folder
3. Upload to Google Drive or send via file transfer
4. **Maintain folder structure in the zip!**

## ✅ Best Practices

### **DO:**
- ✅ Organize files by category in separate folders
- ✅ Use clear, descriptive folder names
- ✅ Keep all files from the same category together
- ✅ Name your folders consistently (e.g., always use "Hentai" not sometimes "hentai" or "Anime")
- ✅ Include multiple files in each folder (batch processing is faster)

### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Mix different categories in one folder
- ❌ Use special characters in folder names (no `#`, `@`, `$`, etc.)
- ❌ Submit files without organizing them into folders
- ❌ Change folder names after we've processed them once
- ❌ Submit In-Stream videos longer than 31 seconds or shorter than 5 seconds

## 🆘 Need Help?

### **Common Questions:**

**Q: Can I submit files without organizing them?**
A: Technically yes, but it's much faster if you organize by category first. We'll need to prompt you for metadata for each file otherwise.

**Q: What if I want to update existing creatives?**
A: Keep the same folder structure! We'll detect and skip duplicates automatically.

**Q: Can I mix anime and realistic in one folder?**
A: Yes, but mark the folder as "Both" style. Or create separate folders for better organization.

**Q: How do I know my files were processed correctly?**
A: You'll receive a CSV inventory with all file details, Creative IDs, and upload status.

**Q: What if my video is 35 seconds?**
A: Trim it to 31 seconds or less for In-Stream videos. Native videos can be any length.
